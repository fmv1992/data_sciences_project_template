    # Summary of what was executed so far:
    # 1) Setting of the random seed for reproducibility.
    # 2) Flusing of intermediate results for a clean run.
    # 3) Data loading and data saving.
    # 4) Conduction of exploratory data analyses.
    # 5) Grid search of best model hyper parameters.
    # To conclude our project we need the grand finale: model selection and
    # evaluation/comparison.
